# C-Labs

This repository contains first year of **KPI University FICE** Labs.

## Labs summaries:

### Part one (first semester)
- **Lab №1:** Simple algorithms that calculate **y** value and check it's existence for segments of a given function depending on **x** variable. First program doesn't use boolean operators *(and, or, not)*, while second - does.
- **Lab №2:** Algorithms that calculate hardcoded expression that contains nested math operations, like:
  - $\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n$
  - $\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_i = a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot \dots \cdot a_n$
  First algorithm uses **Nested Loops** approach, which has $O(n^2)$ time complexity, otherwise second algorithm uses **Dynamic Programming** simple memoization approach that is much more efficient and has $O(log(n))$ time complexity.
- **Lab №3:** Inner spiral ordered matrix traversal with positioned elements printing. Algorithm travels through matrix and visualizes its path on console.
- **Lab №4:** Matrix binary *(most left variation)* search exclusively in the first row and the last column. With parametrized matrix creatation, allowing to control ascending/descending order and duplicates existense.
- **Lab №5:** Shake sort algorithm that sorts main square matrix diagonal in non-ascending order. Program allows to create matrix with ascending, descending and random order.

### Part two (second semester)
- **Lab №1:** To be continued...

All labs were completed by myself with minimal AI help.

# Usage

### Part one

To compile and run program, move to directory where it's located:
```bash
cd path/to/programs/dir
```

Compile the desired program:
```bash
gcc ./filename.c -o compiled-name # gcc example
```

Run the executable:
```bash
./compiled-name
```

### Part two
